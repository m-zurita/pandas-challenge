1) Players between ages 20-24 are the most profitable for the company. Perhaps at this age range there is a good balance between the time they can spend playing and their income.
2) Male players dominate. Could be that women are less interested in games in general or just from that genre.
3) Revenue distribution is not too concentrated in a few items. If it were, there could be balancing issues due to some items being overpowered.
